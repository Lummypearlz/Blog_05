            <p>It talks about the processes of 3D animation.3D animation is a popular and widely used style in various industries, including entertainment, education, medicine, architecture, and advertising. Its appeal lies in its excitement, engagement, and ability to communicate effectively. Businesses rely on 3D animations for brand storytelling, image building, and customer attraction. This article provides an overview of 3D animation, its process, best software, and tips for creating animations online, even for non-pro animators.2D animation is flat, based on a two-dimensional plane with x and y axes, like Pinocchio, Aladdin, and The Lion King. 3D animation, with an additional axis, adds depth and makes animations more realistic.</p>

        <p>The method of producing moving three-dimensional visuals in a computer environment is known as 3D animation. Animators can make digital things that appear 3D even though they are on a 2D surface thanks to the use of 3D software in the creation of these images. Animators may create the illusion of three-dimensional movement in anything from a car in an advertisement to a character in a video game with timing and visual effects.</p>

    <p>By giving that image three dimensions, 3D animation advances the situation. Unlike "flat" 2D animation, the objects and characters in this digital environment have depth and a more realistic appearance. Animators begin with still photos that are divided into individual frames or one whole picture. Our eyes and brains are misled into believing a picture is moving when the frames are combined and played in a certain order.Â Images must be shown at a rate of 12 frames per second or higher in order to provide the impression of movement. The industry standard for hand-drawn, classical animators is 15 frames per second to achieve the beloved cartoon appearance. However, 24 frames per second is standard for people who use 3D animation software.</p>
